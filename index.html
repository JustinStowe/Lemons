        <h1>Welcome to my wonderful attempt at Lemonade Tycoon</h1>
        <p>Lemonade Tycoon, first released as Lemonade Inc., is a Shockwave-based game. A free, limited version is available for
        online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online. The goal of Lemonade
        Tycoon is to sell lemonade for profit.The last update (1.1.9) was renamed Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe. In 2009,
        Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of Lemonade Tycoon. Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition is also available on
        Mac OS X, published by MacPlay.</p>
        
       <p>While selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices,
        and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must
        compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version
        included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. The game allows players
        to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to
        continue.</p>
        
        <p>Lemonade Tycoon has similarities to Lemonade Stand, a computer game originally created for the Minnesota Educational
        Computing Consortium in 1973 and later ported by Apple Computer for use with its then-new Apple II platform in 1979. The
        game also required players to make businesses decisions based upon weather, customers, and cost/availability of stock.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.learningplanet.com">Learning Planet</a>, an educational website, created the original version of the game for teaching economics and resource
        management for its students. The LearningPlanet.com version of Lemonade Tycoon is visually different but functionally
        identical to the other iterations of the game.</p>
