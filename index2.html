                <h2>How to play</h2>
                <p>Stocks/Supplies
                In order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.</p>
                
                <p>Sales and Advertisement
                The player has the option to advertise in Lemonade Tycoon. Every day, the player can pay an advertising fee with
                different choices in advertising being available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.</p>
                
                <p>Upgrades
                Lemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at different prices. Some reduce wait times, some improve
                visibility, some make ice, etc. Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity. There are also employees, a
                cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.</p>
                
                <p>Locations
                There are five different locations where one can move your stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each
                location has a different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity. Popularity changes as the player's stand
                gets more popular. Good satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures that customers will come
                back to the stand. If there are short lines, there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them
                leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player's customer satisfaction will go up. With the increase of
                satisfaction, customers will come back to a player's stand. Satisfaction and popularity are location based. They do not
                travel with you as you move from location to location.</p>
                
                <p>Game Factors
                There are many News Headlines that affect the success of lemonade sales. Some headlines improve the player's business
                and some hurt it. Headlines change every game day and sometimes only affect a single location. Weather also affects
                sales - warm and hot days bring more customers than cold, rainy days. The weather changes each day and does not seem to
                follow predictable patterns.</p>
